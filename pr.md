1. I like the chocolate theme, the color scheme is really nice too and fits with the theme of the site.
2a. My website is center oriented while this site is left-aligned.
2b. I think the user interface is fine, but the buttons should be a bit bigger
2c. The code looks really well organized and maintainable but should separate the css.
3. The code looks really good, however, you should separate the css so that it applies to specific web pages. This makes your css more maintainable.
4. Everything else looks good programming/coding wise. You should make the link buttons bigger so that they are easier to click.
5. I suggest adding more content, the site is a bit empty.
