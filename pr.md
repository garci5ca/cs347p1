1. One thing I liked about this webpage was the colors used. I thought the red coloring brought out the brown in the chocolate pictures.

2. One significant diffrence is scaling, my website was centered and was able to scale to any screen size where as this one was all left aligned and had no scaling. I think mine has a better user experience because the pages are laid out in a way that the content is more focused on what important. I also think mine would be more maintainable as anything can be added to the divs and the website will automatically be adjusted to fit it.

3. I think the code is well structured between files and direcories having css in its own folder and images in another.

4. Some of the other issues I fould was a lack of an animation. I saw an emoji picture that switched every few seconds but would not consider it as an animation. The other issue was that there was no real styling. It looked like the text and images were thrown together last minute and not spaced and styled as well as the nav bar not touching the top of the screen. The CSS does limit duplication by only having one file shared between all the webpages.

5. I would recommend for next time to add the scaling so that when the scree is extended wider or on mobile the website will still be readable and pleasing to the user.
